I have a simple list management app to be developed on iphone.
App allows people to:
a.  create a new list (of phrases)
b.  edit existing lists
c.  upload new lists to a repository on the internet.
d.  download lists from a list repository on the Internet.

The internet repository would ideally be created on firebase, although am open to meteor as well.  Would like Internet repository to also be accessible from PC/Mac browser - perhaps have front end of it in HTML5.

I have sample UI for all of the screens.  Some sample screens are attached here.

If app developer is good, there could be a bunch of follow-on work, include social media (FB and Twitter) integrations.

Would prefer someone with a design sensibility who has UI/UX suggestions.
